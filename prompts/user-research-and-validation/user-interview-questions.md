# User Interview Question Generator

## The Prompt

```
I'm building [PRODUCT DESCRIPTION] for [TARGET CUSTOMER].

Generate 15 user interview questions that will help me:
1. Understand their current workflow and painpoints
2. Validate whether this problem is worth solving
3. Discover what solutions they've already tried
4. Learn their decision-making criteria
5. Identify potential objections or concerns

Organize the questions into these categories:
- Current State (how they do things now)
- Painpoints & Frustrations
- Past Attempts & Workarounds
- Ideal Solution
- Buying Criteria & Objections

Use open-ended questions that encourage storytelling. Avoid yes/no questions.
```

## Example Usage

```
<!-- Example 1: Project Management Tool -->

<!-- Example 2: Meal Planning App -->
I'm building a meal planning app for busy parents with picky eaters.

<!-- Example 3: Freelancer Invoicing -->
I'm building an automated invoicing system for freelance developers.
```

## Interview Best Practices

**Do's:**
- ✅ Ask "Tell me about the last time you..." (gets specific stories)
- ✅ Use "Why?" and "How?" to dig deeper
- ✅ Listen for emotional language
- ✅ Ask about money spent on current solutions
- ✅ Let silence hang - people fill it with insights

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Don't pitch your solution during research phase
- ❌ Don't ask "Would you use this?" (people lie)
- ❌ Don't lead with your assumptions
- ❌ Don't skip the "awkward" money questions
- ❌ Don't interview only friends/family

## Follow-Up Prompt

After generating questions, refine them:

```
Review these interview questions. Remove any that:
- Could be answered with yes/no
- Lead the interviewee toward a specific answer
- Ask about hypothetical future behavior instead of past behavior
- Are too vague or broad

Replace them with more specific, story-driven questions.
```
