# User Persona Development

## The Prompt

```
Based on my user research, help me create a detailed user persona for [PRODUCT/SERVICE].

Here's what I know about my target customers:
[PASTE YOUR RESEARCH FINDINGS - interview notes, survey results, social media painpoints]

Create a persona that includes:

**Demographics & Context:**
- Name and role
- Age range and life stage
- Professional context
- Technical proficiency level

**Goals & Motivations:**
- What are they trying to achieve?
- What does success look like for them?
- What motivates them to seek solutions?

**Painpoints & Frustrations:**
- Current struggles (ranked by severity)
- Emotional impact of these problems
- Cost of not solving (time, money, stress)

**Current Behavior:**
- How they currently handle this problem
- Tools/solutions they're already using
- Where they spend time online
- How they discover new solutions

**Buying Criteria:**
- What matters most in a solution?
- Deal-breakers and must-haves
- Budget considerations
- Decision-making process

**Objections & Barriers:**
- Why might they NOT buy?
- What concerns need addressing?
- Past experiences with similar solutions

Include a "Day in the Life" scenario showing when and how they'd encounter the problem I'm solving.

Use real quotes from my research whenever possible.

## When to Create Personas

- ✅ **After** conducting 5+ user interviews
- ✅ **After** analyzing social media painpoints
- ✅ When you have enough data to spot patterns
- ❌ **Before** doing any research (avoid assumption-based personas)

## Tips for Actionable Personas

**Make Them Specific:**
- ❌ "Marketing Manager at a B2B company"
- ✅ "Sarah, Growth Marketing Manager at a 20-person B2B SaaS startup, reports to CEO, manages no direct reports, responsible for all demand gen but no budget for agencies"

**Focus on Jobs to Be Done:**
Don't just describe who they are - describe what they're trying to accomplish:
- "Needs to prove marketing ROI to secure next quarter's budget"
- "Wants to reduce time spent on manual reporting from 10 hours/week to under 2"

**Include Actual Quotes:**
Real language from interviews makes personas credible and useful for copywriting.

## Multiple Personas

If you serve different customer segments:

```
I have research on [NUMBER] different customer segments. Help me:
1. Identify the key differences between these segments
2. Decide if I need separate personas or if they can be combined
3. Determine which segment should be my primary focus for MVP
4. Create a primary persona and secondary persona

Here's my research data:
[PASTE FINDINGS]
```

## Using Your Personas

Once created, use this follow-up prompt:

```
Here's my user persona: [PASTE PERSONA]

Now help me:
1. Write a homepage headline that speaks directly to their painpoint
2. Identify which features matter most to them (vs. nice-to-haves)
3. Determine the best channels to reach them
4. Craft a cold outreach message they'd actually respond to
```
