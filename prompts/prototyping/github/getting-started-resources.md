## Quick Tips for Success

âœ… **Start Simple**: Create a test repository to practice before using it for real projects
âœ… **Commit Often**: Save your changes frequently with clear descriptions of what you did
âœ… **Use Descriptive Names**: Name repositories clearly (e.g., "my-fitness-app" not "project1")
âœ… **Don't Panic**: You can't permanently break anything - GitHub keeps history of all changes
âœ… **Public vs Private**: Make repositories private if you don't want others to see your code
âœ… **README Files**: Add a README.md to explain what your project does - it's the first thing people see
