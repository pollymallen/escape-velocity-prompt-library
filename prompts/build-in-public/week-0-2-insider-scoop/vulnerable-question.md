## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Vulnerable Question" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**The Problem I'm Seeing:**
[Describe the problem clearly - e.g., "Content creators spend hours reformatting posts for different platforms"]

**My Initial Solution Idea:**
[Pitch your solution in 1-2 sentences - e.g., "A tool that automatically adapts your content for Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram based on each platform's best practices"]

**What I'm Uncertain About:**
[Optional - share your doubts or concerns - e.g., "Not sure if people would trust AI to adapt their voice", "Worried this might be a 'nice-to-have' not a 'need-to-have'"]

**Target Audience:**
[Who is this for? e.g., "content creators", "indie hackers", "small business owners"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "Honest question: Would you actually use [solution concept]?"

**Body:**
- Briefly describe the problem you're seeing (keep it relatable)
- Pitch your initial solution idea (1-2 sentences max)
- Show vulnerability - admit you're uncertain
- Make it easy to say "no" (this gets more honest responses)

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Be brutally honest - is this dumb or am I onto something?"
- "What am I missing here?"
- "Would you pay for this or just use [free alternative]?"

---

## Best Practices

- **True vulnerability:** Don't fake uncertainty if you're already convinced
- **Make rejection easy:** "Tell me if this is stupid" gets better feedback than "Tell me you love it"
- **Keep solution simple:** Don't oversell or over-explain
- **Accept criticism gracefully:** Reply positively to negative feedback
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Use a poll for quick yes/no validation
  - LinkedIn: Can be slightly more detailed on the problem
  - Instagram: Use Stories poll feature for immediate feedback

## Example Output

"Honest question: Would you actually use an AI that rewrites your LinkedIn posts for Twitter?

Here's the problem I keep seeing: Content creators write great LinkedIn posts but they bomb on Twitter because the tone/format is all wrong. So they either skip Twitter or manually rewrite everything.

I'm thinking about building a tool that adapts your content for each platform while keeping your voice intact.

Be brutally honest - is this dumb or am I onto something?

(Also: would you pay $10/month for this or just do it manually?)"
