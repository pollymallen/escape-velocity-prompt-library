## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Research Share" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**Industry/Niche I'm Researching:**
[e.g., "SaaS onboarding", "freelance marketplace", "productivity tools for remote teams"]

**The Gap or Insight Nobody Is Talking About:**
[What's the overlooked problem or opportunity? e.g., "Most productivity tools ignore async work patterns", "Onboarding focuses on features, not outcomes"]

**Specific Examples or Data Points (2-3):**
1. [e.g., "Only 15% of users complete onboarding flows"]
2. [e.g., "Average user tries 4 different tools before settling"]
3. [e.g., "Churn happens within first 7 days for 60% of users"]

**What I'm Curious About:**
[What pricing or value question do you want to explore?]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "Here's what nobody is talking about in [industry/niche]..."

**Body:**
- Present your research findings or gap you've identified
- Share 2-3 specific examples or data points
- Make it educational but not preachy
- Show your expertise through insights, not claims

**Engagement Ask:**
- "What would YOU pay to solve this problem?"
- "Am I seeing this wrong? What's your experience?"

---

## Best Practices

- **Lead with value:** Share something genuinely interesting
- **Use data:** Numbers and specifics build credibility
- **Stay curious:** You're sharing findings, not selling
- **Price validation:** The payment question helps gauge market demand
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Use a thread format to present multiple data points
  - LinkedIn: Professional tone, cite sources if applicable
  - Instagram: Create a carousel with each data point as a slide

## Example Output

"Here's what nobody is talking about in the SaaS onboarding space...

Everyone obsesses over feature tours and tooltips, but I just analyzed 50+ SaaS products and found something interesting:

→ 72% of users skip onboarding tutorials entirely
→ The ones who DO complete onboarding are 3x more likely to churn
→ Users who jump straight into 'doing' stay 2x longer

The gap? Onboarding is teaching features, not helping users accomplish their actual goal.

What would YOU pay to solve this problem?

(I'm building something around this - more soon)"
