Help me craft a "Problem Discovery" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

[Describe who you've been talking to - e.g., "freelance designers", "SaaS founders", "e-commerce store owners"]

**The Surprising Insight/Pain Point I Discovered:**
[Share what shocked you - e.g., "They're spending 5+ hours a week on manual data entry", "90% said they'd rather pay more than deal with setup complexity"]

**Context/How I Discovered This:**

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "I just spent 3 hours talking to [target audience] and I'm honestly shocked by what I learned..."

**Body:**
- Share the surprising insight or pain point you discovered
- Make it specific and relatable
- Show authentic curiosity, not just validation-seeking

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Does this resonate with anyone else? Am I missing something?"
- "DM me if you've experienced this too - I want to hear your story"

---

## Best Practices

- **Be vulnerable:** Show genuine surprise or confusion
- **Use specifics:** Numbers, quotes, real examples make it believable
- **Ask, don't tell:** You're seeking validation, not announcing a solution
- **Reply to every comment:** Especially in the first hour
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Keep concise, maybe use a thread for details
  - LinkedIn: Can go longer, more professional tone
  - Instagram: Pair with a visual of your research process

## Example Output

"I just spent 3 hours talking to freelance designers and I'm honestly shocked by what I learned...

95% of them are spending 4-6 hours EVERY WEEK chasing down client feedback on design mockups. They're using email, Slack, WhatsApp, and even text messages. The scattered feedback is killing their productivity.

One designer told me: 'I spend more time managing feedback than actually designing.'

Does this resonate with anyone else? Am I missing something?

DM me if you've experienced this too - I want to hear your story."
