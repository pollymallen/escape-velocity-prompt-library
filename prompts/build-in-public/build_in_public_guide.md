## **COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID**

1. **Broadcasting vs. Engaging** - Don't just announce, ask and listen
2. **Perfectionism** - Rough and real beats polished and late
3. **Inconsistency** - Post regularly (aim for 3-5x per week minimum)
4. **Ignoring Negative Feedback** - Engage with criticism professionally
5. **Over-Promising** - Under-promise, over-deliver
6. **Forgetting to Ask** - Always include a call-to-action or question
7. **Being Too Salesy** - Share journey first, sell second
8. **Not Tracking Metrics** - Know what's working (engagement rate, follower growth, conversions)

## **CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE**

Each entrepreneur's journey is unique. Adapt these templates by:

- **Adding your voice** - Use your natural speaking style
- **Including specifics** - Replace placeholders with real details
- **Matching your audience** - Adjust tone for your target market
- **Platform optimization** - Modify format for where you're posting
- **Timing adjustments** - Not all products take 12 weeks; scale accordingly
- **Visual elements** - Add screenshots, mockups, demos when possible

---

**Remember:** Building in public is about bringing people along on your journey, not just promoting a product. Be real, be consistent, and engage authentically with those who show interest. Your audience is your co-creation partner, not just future customers.

Good luck with your launch! ðŸš€
