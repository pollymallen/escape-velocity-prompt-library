## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Sneak Peek" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**Product Name:**
[Your product name]

**What You're Showing:**
[Describe the visual - e.g., "Dashboard UI", "Mobile app demo", "Homepage design", "Key feature in action"]

**The "Catch" or Tease:**
[What are you NOT showing or explaining fully? e.g., "The secret sauce behind how it works", "One feature I'm keeping under wraps", "The pricing model"]

**One Standout Feature to Hint At:**
[Without explaining fully - e.g., "It learns your preferences automatically", "Handles 10x more data than competitors", "Works completely offline"]

**Visual Description:**
[Describe what the screenshot/demo shows - help AI understand what people will see]

**What Stage Are You At:**
[e.g., "2 weeks from beta", "MVP almost ready", "Rough prototype"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "First look at [product name] - but there's a catch..."

**Body:**
- Share a compelling visual or demo video (even if rough)
- Tease one standout feature without explaining fully
- Create curiosity gap - show enough to intrigue, not enough to explain everything
- Acknowledge if it's rough/early
- Build exclusivity: "You're seeing this before anyone else"

**Engagement Ask:**
- "What do you want to see more of? Reply with questions."
- "What's the first thing you notice?"
- "Drop a ðŸ”¥ if you want early access when it's ready"

---

## Best Practices

- **Show, don't just tell:** Actual visual > description
- **Rough is okay:** "Early prototype" builds authenticity
- **Create FOMO:** "First look", "Before anyone else"
- **Leave them wanting more:** Don't explain everything
- **Ask open questions:** Collect real curiosity
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Native video or high-quality image performs best
  - LinkedIn: Can include more context, professional framing
  - Instagram: Stories + polls for immediate feedback, carousel for multi-angle view

## Example Output

"First look at [Product Name] - but there's a catch...

This is the dashboard you'll see when you log in. But I'm not showing you the coolest part yet ðŸ‘€

[Screenshot of dashboard UI]

Here's what I CAN tell you:
â†’ It connects to 5+ data sources automatically
â†’ Updates in real-time without refreshing
â†’ That sidebar? It learns your workflow and adapts

Launch is 3 weeks away. This is rough but I wanted to show YOU first.

What do you want to see more of? Reply with questions.

Drop a ðŸ”¥ if you want early access when it's ready."
