## Prompt for AI

Help me craft an "Origin Story" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**The Moment/Experience That Started This:**
[Describe the specific moment - e.g., "I missed my daughter's birthday because I was stuck in spreadsheets", "I lost a client because my invoicing was a mess", "I spent $500 on tools that didn't solve my problem"]

**Why It Was Embarrassing/Frustrating/Relatable:**
[The human element - e.g., "I'm supposed to be the 'organized' one", "I teach productivity but couldn't manage my own workflow", "I felt stupid paying so much for something so basic"]

**The Realization:**
[What did you realize? e.g., "Existing solutions were built for corporations, not freelancers", "Everyone else was struggling with this too", "This shouldn't be this hard"]

**What You Decided To Do:**
[Your response - e.g., "Built a tool specifically for [audience]", "Decided to solve this once and for all", "Started this 90-day journey"]

**Current Status:**
[Where are you now? e.g., "3 weeks from launch", "Beta testing with 50 users", "MVP is ready"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "This idea started because I [embarrassing/relatable moment]..."

**Body:**
- Tell the personal story behind why you're building this
- Make it vulnerable and relatable
- Show the emotional journey, not just the logical problem
- Include specific details that make it real
- Connect it to your audience's experience

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Anyone else ever felt this way?"
- "Tell me I'm not the only one..."
- "What was YOUR 'that's it, I'm building something' moment?"

---

## Best Practices

- **Vulnerability wins:** The more personal, the more engaging
- **Specific details:** "My daughter's birthday" > "A family event"
- **Show the emotion:** Frustration, embarrassment, determination
- **Connect to audience:** They should see themselves in your story
- **End with transformation:** Where you started → where you are now
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Thread format for storytelling
  - LinkedIn: Longer narrative works well, professional lessons
  - Instagram: Carousel with story beats, or video telling the story

## Example Output

"This idea started because I missed my kid's soccer game... again.

I was supposed to leave work at 4pm. But I was drowning in invoices, late payments, and tracking down what clients owed me.

By the time I looked up, it was 6pm. I'd missed the whole thing.

I'm a freelance designer. I should be DESIGNING. Instead I spent 10+ hours a week being a part-time accountant.

That night, I looked for a tool built for freelancers like me. Everything I found was either:
→ Too complex (built for agencies with 50+ employees)
→ Too limited (just invoicing, no project tracking)
→ Too expensive ($50+/month for features I didn't need)

So I built [Product Name].

No bloat. No learning curve. Just what freelancers actually need:
→ Track time and projects
→ Send invoices
→ Get paid

Launch is 3 weeks away. This one's personal.

Anyone else ever felt this way?"
