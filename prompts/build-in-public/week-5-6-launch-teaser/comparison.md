## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Comparison" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**Competitor/Current Solution You Used:**
[e.g., "Notion", "Trello", "Excel spreadsheets", "Manual process", "Current industry standard"]

**How Long You Used It:**
[e.g., "6 months", "2 years", "My whole career"]

**The Gap or Frustration You Experienced:**
[What was missing or frustrating? e.g., "Too complex for simple tasks", "Doesn't integrate with X", "Requires too much manual work", "Too expensive for small teams"]

**Your Unique Approach:**
[How is your product different? e.g., "Built for [specific use case]", "Automation-first design", "One-third the price", "Works offline"]

**What You're NOT Doing:**
[Optional - what common features did you intentionally leave out and why?]

**Target Audience:**
[Who is this for specifically?]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "I used [competitor/current solution] for [time period]. Here's why I built something different..."

**Body:**
- Briefly mention the gap in existing solutions (stay respectful)
- Highlight your unique approach without being salesy
- Focus on the problem you're solving, not just features
- Show empathy: "I felt this pain too"
- Be specific about who it's for

**Engagement Ask:**
- "What frustrates YOU most about [current solutions]?"
- "Would this approach work for you?"
- "What am I missing about [competitor]?"

---

## Best Practices

- **Respect competitors:** Focus on gaps, not attacks
- **Be specific:** "Lacks automation" > "It's bad"
- **Show your experience:** Using competitor = credibility
- **Target clearly:** Not "for everyone," for [specific group]
- **Stay humble:** Your approach isn't perfect either
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Keep punchy, comparison table works well
  - LinkedIn: Professional tone, focus on problem-solving
  - Instagram: Visual comparison (side-by-side) performs well

## Example Output

"I used Notion for 6 months to manage my freelance projects. Here's why I built something different...

Don't get me wrong - Notion is powerful. But I found myself:
→ Spending more time organizing than actually working
→ Creating complex templates just to track basic tasks
→ Constantly tweaking the setup instead of getting things done

It's built for power users who love customization. I needed something simpler.

So I built [Product Name] for freelancers who want:
→ Zero setup: works out of the box
→ Automatic time tracking and invoicing
→ One place for tasks, clients, and money

Not reinventing project management. Just making it actually simple for solopreneurs.

What frustrates YOU most about current project management tools?
