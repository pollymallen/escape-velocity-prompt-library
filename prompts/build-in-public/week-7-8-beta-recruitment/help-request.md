# Help Request Post Template

**Use this template when:** You want to frame beta testing as collaboration rather than asking for a favor.

**Goal:** Recruit testers by positioning them as partners who help shape the product, not just users finding bugs.

## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Help Request" social media post for beta tester recruitment. Here's the information:

**Product Name:**
[Your product name]

**What You're Asking For:**
[e.g., "Help breaking my product", "Find the edge cases I missed", "Test if this actually solves the problem"]

**Specific Things to Test (2-3):**
1. [e.g., "Does the onboarding make sense?"]
2. [e.g., "Is the pricing clear?"]
3. [e.g., "Can you break the export feature?"]

**What Testers Influence:**
[e.g., "Final feature set", "Pricing structure", "UI/UX decisions"]

**What They Get:**
[Benefits - e.g., "Early adopter pricing", "Free lifetime access", "Credits/discounts", "Recognition in launch post"]

**How Many Testers:**
[e.g., "Looking for 30 testers", "Limited spots available"]

**Ideal Tester Profile:**
[Who would be perfect? e.g., "People who currently use [competitor]", "Anyone who struggles with [problem]"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "I need your help breaking my product..."

**Body:**
- Frame beta testing as collaboration, not a favor
- List 2-3 specific things you want tested
- Show their input matters: "Your feedback will shape..."
- Emphasize partnership: "build this WITH me"
- Make the value exchange clear

**Call-to-Action:**
- "Who wants early access + the ability to shape this before launch?"
- "Comment if you want in - limited spots"
- "DM me if this sounds like you"

---

## Best Practices

- **Partnership framing:** "Help me build" not "test for me"
- **Specific asks:** What exactly do you need tested?
- **Show impact:** Their feedback will actually change things
- **Respectful of time:** Be honest about commitment
- **Incentivize honestly:** Don't over-promise rewards
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Direct, conversational tone
  - LinkedIn: Emphasize professional learning opportunity
  - Instagram: Visual showing what they'll test

## Example Output

"I need your help breaking my product...

[Product Name] launches in 3 weeks and I need people to stress-test it BEFORE real users see it.

Specifically, I need you to:
→ Go through onboarding and tell me where you get confused
→ Try to break the export feature (seriously, try)
→ Tell me if the pricing makes sense or feels off

Your feedback will directly shape:
→ Which features make it into V1
→ How I position this at launch
→ What I charge (and how)

In exchange:
→ Free access during beta
→ 50% off lifetime if you stick around
→ Direct input on what I build next

This is NOT just bug reporting. You're helping me build this. Limited spots.

Who wants early access + the ability to shape this before launch?

Comment below and I'll send you the link."
