## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "Looking for [X number] [specific type of person] to try [product] and tell me exactly what sucks..."

**Body:**
- Be specific about who you need (not just "anyone")
- Explain the time commitment upfront
- Offer clear incentive (price break, lifetime access, credit)
- Make it easy to refer others
- Create FOMO with numbers and timing

**Call-to-Action:**
- "Tag someone who fits this + comment if it's you"
- "Know someone perfect for this? Tag them below"
- "Comment or DM - first [X] get in"

---

## Best Practices

- **Hyper-specific targeting:** "Freelance designers" > "creative people"
- **Social CTA:** Tagging creates reach + social proof
- **Real incentives:** Offer something actually valuable
- **Transparent commitment:** Don't hide the time required
- **Urgency:** Limited spots + start date creates action
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Tagging works well, creates threads
  - LinkedIn: Professional specificity, tag relevant connections
  - Instagram: Stories with mention stickers

"Looking for 30 freelance designers to try [Product Name] and tell me exactly what sucks...

**You're perfect for this if:**
→ You're freelancing full-time (or trying to)
→ You juggle 3+ clients at once
→ Client feedback is scattered across 5 different tools

**Time commitment:**
→ 20 minutes per week for 3 weeks
→ Test features as they ship
→ Give brutally honest feedback

**What you get:**
→ Free lifetime access (normally $25/month)
→ Early adopter badge + recognition at launch
→ Your specific pain points = features I build

This is for client feedback management - no more chasing comments across email, Slack, and WhatsApp.

Testing starts Friday. Limited to 30 people.

Tag someone who fits this + comment if it's you.

(DM me if you want in but don't want to comment publicly)"
