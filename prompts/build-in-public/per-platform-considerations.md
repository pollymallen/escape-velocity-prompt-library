# Per-Platform Considerations for Building in Public

Different platforms have unique cultures, algorithms, and audience expectations. Use this guide to adapt your build-in-public content for maximum engagement on each channel.

---

## Twitter/X

### What Works Well:
- **Short, punchy updates** - Brevity is key, get to the point fast
- **Thread storytelling** - Longer stories broken into digestible tweets
- **Real-time updates** - Multiple posts throughout the day showing progress
- **Contrarian takes** - Hot takes and friendly debates drive engagement
- **Polls** - Quick validation and audience participation
- **Visual previews** - Screenshots, mockups, short demo videos
- **@mentions and replies** - Public conversations build visibility
- **Retweets with commentary** - Quote-tweet your own updates with progress

### Posting Style:
- Conversational, casual tone
- Use line breaks for readability (â†’ bullets work well)
- Ask questions to drive replies (algorithm boost)
- Post during peak hours (weekdays 9am-3pm ET)

### Engagement Tactics:
- Reply to EVERY comment in first hour
- Use relevant hashtags sparingly (1-2 max)
- Tag relevant people/communities
- Pin important posts (launch announcement)

---

## LinkedIn

### What Works Well:
- **Longer-form storytelling** - 1,300+ character posts perform best
- **Professional lessons** - Frame personal stories as business insights
- **Carousels** - Multi-slide PDFs with key takeaways
- **Vulnerability + learning** - Authentic failures with professional framing
- **Milestone celebrations** - Achievements tied to career growth
- **Industry insights** - Position yourself as a thought leader
- **Data and metrics** - Numbers, charts, results resonate

### Posting Style:
- Professional but authentic (not corporate jargon)
- Start with a hook, tell a story, end with a lesson
- Use white space - short paragraphs with line breaks
- First 2-3 lines are critical (show before "see more")
- Emojis sparingly and professionally

### Engagement Tactics:
- Post early morning (7-9am) or lunch (12-1pm)
- Engage with comments thoughtfully
- Tag companies/people when relevant
- Native content > external links (algorithm penalizes links)

---

## Facebook

### What Works Well:
- **Visual content** - Photos, videos, live streams
- **Personal stories** - More emotional, less business-formal
- **Longer narratives** - Facebook users read longer posts
- **Community building** - Conversations in comments
- **Live video updates** - High algorithm priority
- **Life behind the business** - Humanizing content

### Posting Style:
- Warm, friendly, conversational
- Tell stories, not just updates
- Use native video when possible
- Ask direct questions at the end
- Tag relevant people to expand reach

### Engagement Tactics:
- Post when your audience is online (check Insights)
- Respond to comments within 1 hour
- Use Facebook Stories for behind-the-scenes
- Create events for launch milestones

---

## Facebook Groups (Your Own or Others')

### What Works Well:
- **Asking for help/advice** - Groups are for collaboration
- **Sharing lessons learned** - Give value, not just promotion
- **Polls and questions** - High engagement
- **Behind-the-scenes exclusives** - Make members feel special
- **Beta testing recruitment** - Groups are warm audiences
- **Responding to relevant discussions** - Add value before promoting

### Posting Style:
- Helpful first, promotional second
- "I'm struggling with X, anyone dealt with this?" works well
- Share generously - teach what you've learned
- Follow group rules strictly (many ban self-promotion)

### Best Practices:
- Read group rules before posting anything promotional
- Build credibility by contributing value first
- Ask admin permission for beta testing recruitment
- Don't drop links without context
- Respond to every reply in your thread

---

## Reddit

### What Works Well:
- **Radical transparency** - Redditors smell BS immediately
- **Detailed breakdowns** - Long-form content with real insights
- **AMAs (Ask Me Anything)** - When you have something valuable to share
- **Specific advice requests** - "How did you solve X?" gets engagement
- **Failure stories** - Honest post-mortems are gold
- **Progress updates with proof** - Screenshots, metrics, evidence

### Posting Style:
- NO promotional language - Redditors hate selling
- Be humble, not boastful
- Give way more value than you ask for
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Proof is everything - screenshots, metrics, examples

### Platform Warnings:
- **Most subreddits ban self-promotion** - Read rules carefully
- Build karma by contributing value before posting your own stuff
- Expect brutal honesty - thick skin required
- Don't mention your product in title unless rules allow
- Never spam multiple subreddits (cross-posting is often banned)

### Subreddits for Building in Public:
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/SideProject
- r/startups
- r/IndieBiz
- r/SaaS
- r/buildinpublic
- Check rules for each - many have specific days for promotion

---

## Indie Hackers / Product Hunt

### What Works Well:
- **Metrics transparency** - Revenue, users, growth numbers
- **Behind-the-scenes building** - Technical details welcome
- **Milestone updates** - First dollar, first 10 customers, etc.
- **Honest retrospectives** - What worked, what didn't
- **Asking specific questions** - "How did you solve X?"
- **Launch announcements** - Product Hunt is built for this

### Posting Style:
- Direct, no fluff
- Numbers and metrics front and center
- Technical details are appreciated
- Links to your product are expected and welcome
- Founder-to-founder tone

### Engagement Tactics:
- Comment on others' posts before posting yours
- Time Product Hunt launches for 12:01am PST
- Respond to every comment on launch day
- Share honest numbers - good and bad

---

## Niche Online Communities (Forums, Discord, Slack Groups)

### What Works Well:
- **Hyper-relevant content** - Only post if genuinely relevant
- **Helping others first** - Establish credibility before promoting
- **Asking community-specific questions** - Leverage collective expertise
- **Exclusive previews** - Make community feel like insiders
- **Responding to discussions** - Add value in existing threads

### Posting Style:
- Match the community's tone and culture
- Lurk first to understand norms
- Reference community inside jokes/language
- Give credit when you learn from the community

### Best Practices:
- Spend 10x more time contributing than promoting
- Ask admin/moderators before posting promotional content
- Offer community-exclusive perks (early access, discounts)
- Never join just to promote and leave
- Respect that communities aren't free marketing channels

## Multi-Platform Strategy

**Don't just copy-paste across platforms.** Each requires adaptation:

1. **Create for one primary platform** - Where is your audience most active?
2. **Adapt strategically** - Use the prompt above to modify for 2-3 other platforms
3. **Timing matters** - Post at optimal times for each platform
4. **Track what works** - Different audiences respond differently
5. **Go deep, not wide** - Better to dominate 2 platforms than suck at 5

**Suggested combos:**
- **B2B SaaS:** Twitter/X + LinkedIn + Indie Hackers
- **Consumer product:** Twitter/X + Instagram + Reddit
- **Technical product:** Twitter/X + Reddit + Hacker News
- **Community-focused:** Twitter/X + Facebook Groups + Discord

Remember: Building in public works best when you consistently show up where YOUR audience already hangs out.
