## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Preparation Transparency" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**Days Until Launch:**
[e.g., "5 days", "72 hours", "Launch Monday"]

**How You're Feeling (Be Honest):**
[Mix of emotions - e.g., "Excited and terrified", "Can't sleep but in a good way", "Nervous but ready", "Questioning everything but pushing through"]

**What You're Doing in These Final Days:**
1. [e.g., "Final bug testing"]
2. [e.g., "Writing launch content"]
3. [e.g., "Setting up payment system"]
4. [e.g., "Reaching out to potential early users"]

**What Keeps You Up at Night:**
[Honest concerns - e.g., "What if nobody signs up?", "What if it breaks on day 1?", "Did I miss something obvious?"]

**What You're Confident About:**
[Balance the vulnerability - e.g., "The product solves a real problem", "Beta testers loved it", "I've learned so much"]

**Your Commitment/Promise:**
[e.g., "I'm shipping no matter what", "I'll support every early user personally", "This is just V1, we'll improve together"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "[X] days until launch. Here's my honest mental state right now..."

**Body:**
- Share how you're feeling (both excited and nervous)
- List what you're doing in these final days
- Be vulnerable about fears/doubts
- Balance with what you're confident about
- Build anticipation with countdown
- Show commitment to shipping and supporting users

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Any last-minute advice from those who've launched before?"
- "Tell me your launch day story - I need perspective"
- "What should I absolutely NOT forget?"

---

## Best Practices

- **Real emotions:** Mix of excitement and fear feels authentic
- **Specific prep:** "Writing launch tweets" > "getting ready"
- **Balanced vulnerability:** Nervous but not defeated
- **Countdown creates urgency:** Exact days/hours
- **Community support:** Ask for advice, build connection
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Raw, real-time updates work well
  - LinkedIn: Professional but still authentic
  - Instagram: Behind-the-scenes Stories showing actual prep work

## Example Output

"5 days until launch. Here's my honest mental state right now...

I'm simultaneously:
→ More excited than I've ever been
→ Terrified nobody will sign up
→ Confident the product works
→ Worried I missed something obvious
→ Ready to ship this thing

**What I'm doing these final days:**
→ Final bug testing (found 3 more issues today)
→ Writing launch content for Twitter, LinkedIn, and Product Hunt
→ Setting up customer support systems
→ Reaching out to everyone who said "tell me when it's ready"
→ Not sleeping much (but in a good way... I think)

**What keeps me up at night:**
What if I spent 12 weeks building something nobody wants?

**What I keep reminding myself:**
→ 50 beta testers validated this is useful
→ The problem is real (I lived it myself)
→ V1 doesn't have to be perfect
→ I can iterate based on real users

Launch is Monday. Ready or not, I'm shipping this.

Any last-minute advice from those who've launched before? What should I absolutely NOT forget?

(Also: if you've been following along, drop a comment. I need the encouragement right now.)"
