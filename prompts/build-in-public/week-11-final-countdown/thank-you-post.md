## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Thank You Post" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**Product Name:**
[Your product name]

**Launch Date:**
[e.g., "3 days away", "This Friday", "December 15th"]

**Specific Contributions From Your Audience:**
[What did they help with? e.g., "Validated the initial idea", "50 beta testers found 200+ bugs", "Voted on features", "Gave brutally honest feedback that changed the UX"]

**Key Changes Made Because of Feedback:**
[Specific examples - e.g., "Simplified the dashboard after beta feedback", "Added offline mode because 12 people requested it", "Changed pricing based on 100+ survey responses"]

**How Their Input Shaped the Product:**
[e.g., "Without you, this would've been bloated and confusing", "Your feedback made this actually useful", "You helped me avoid launching something nobody wanted"]

**What You're Doing For Them at Launch:**
[Special recognition or offer - e.g., "Special pricing for everyone who followed along", "Beta testers get lifetime free access", "Thank you discount code"]

**Launch Teaser:**
[Optional - brief hint at something special - e.g., "Something special for everyone who commented/followed"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "I couldn't have built this without you. Let me explain..."

**Body:**
- Thank your audience for specific contributions
- Show how their input shaped the product (concrete examples)
- Build community feeling: "We built this together"
- Make it personal and genuine
- Tease something special for loyal followers

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Who's been here since [early milestone]?"
- "Comment if you remember [specific moment in journey]"
- Soft tease: "Launch is [X] days away and I have something special for everyone who's been following along..."

## Best Practices

- **Specific thanks:** Name contributions, not generic praise
- **Show impact:** "Your feedback changed X" with examples
- **Genuine emotion:** This should feel real, not performative
- **Include everyone:** Beta testers AND lurkers who followed
- **Forward-looking:** Thanks + excitement for what's next
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Thread showing journey highlights with community moments
  - LinkedIn: Professional appreciation, business collaboration framing
  - Instagram: Carousel with screenshots of key feedback moments

## Example Output

"I couldn't have built this without you. Let me explain...

12 weeks ago, I shared a wild idea about fixing client feedback chaos for freelancers. You could've ignored it. Instead...

**You helped me:**
→ Validate the problem (150+ DMs saying "I need this")
→ Test the beta (50 of you found 200+ bugs)
→ Shape the features (offline mode exists because of you)
→ Fix what sucked (the dashboard is 10x simpler now)

I built [Product Name], but WE created something people will actually use.

**Specific shoutouts:**
→ @person who told me my pricing was confusing (changed it)
→ The designer who said my UI looked like 2015 (ouch, but fair)
→ Beta testers who spent hours breaking things so users won't have to

Without your brutally honest feedback, I would've launched something bloated and confusing.

Launch is 3 days away and I have something special for everyone who's been following along...

Who's been here since the beginning? Comment below - I want to know who to thank personally.

(Seriously, thank you. This has been the hardest and most rewarding thing I've ever done.)"
