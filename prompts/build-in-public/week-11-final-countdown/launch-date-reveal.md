## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "It's official: [Product] launches [date]. Here's what happens next..."

**Body:**
- Announce the specific launch date clearly
- Build excitement with 2-3 key features or benefits
- Create urgency (limited spots, launch pricing, time-bound offer)
- Show who it's for
- Make the value proposition crystal clear
- Strong call-to-action

**Call-to-Action:**
- "Drop your email in the comments for early access"
- "Join the waitlist: [link]"
- "First 100 to comment get [special offer]"

---

## Best Practices

- **Specific date:** "December 15th" not "soon" or "next month"
- **Real urgency:** Limited spots or time-sensitive offers only if true
- **Clear benefit:** What problem does it solve?
- **Easy action:** Low-friction CTA (comment, click, sign up)
- **Countdown language:** "X days away", "Final countdown"
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Pin this tweet, quote-tweet with updates
  - LinkedIn: Professional framing, business benefits
  - Instagram: Countdown sticker in Stories, link in bio
