# Beta Insights Post Template

**Use this template when:** Your beta testers gave you surprising or game-changing feedback.

**Goal:** Show you're listening to users and iterating based on real feedback, building trust with your audience.

## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Beta Insights" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**The Surprising Feedback:**
[What did beta testers say that shocked you? e.g., "They completely ignored the main feature I spent 2 months on", "They want it simpler, not more powerful", "The pricing structure confused everyone"]

**What You Expected vs. Reality:**
- Expected: [e.g., "Users would love the advanced dashboard"]
- Reality: [e.g., "They just want a simple list view"]

**Why This Matters:**
[Impact - e.g., "This changes the entire UX approach", "This affects our positioning", "This means pivoting the core feature"]

**How You're Changing Your Approach:**
[Specific changes - e.g., "Removing 5 features and simplifying to 3 core actions", "Redesigning onboarding from scratch", "Changing pricing from per-feature to flat monthly"]

**What You're Keeping:**
[What validated - e.g., "The core problem is real", "The design language works", "People love feature X"]

**Question for Audience:**
[Validation question - e.g., "Would this change make it better or worse for you?", "Does this resonate more?"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "Beta testers just said [surprising feedback]. I did NOT see this coming..."

**Body:**
- Share unexpected feedback from beta testers
- Show the gap between expectation and reality
- Explain how it's changing your approach
- Demonstrate you're listening and iterating
- Show humility: you were wrong about something

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Would this change make it better or worse for you?"
- "Am I overreacting or is this the right move?"
- "Anyone else completely miss the mark on first try?"

---

## Best Practices

- **Genuine surprise:** Real unexpected feedback, not staged
- **Show humility:** "I was wrong about X"
- **Specific changes:** Not vague "we're improving" but concrete pivots
- **Validate publicly:** Turn audience into co-validators
- **Thank testers:** Acknowledge those who gave feedback
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Before/after comparison works well
  - LinkedIn: Emphasize learning and iteration
  - Instagram: Visual showing old vs. new approach

## Example Output

"Beta testers just said [surprising insight]. I did NOT see this coming...

I spent 6 weeks building an advanced analytics dashboard with 20+ metrics and customizable views.

Guess what? Nobody used it.

**What beta testers actually said:**
→ "Too overwhelming, I just want to see [one key metric]"
→ "I don't have time to customize anything"
→ "Can you just show me what matters and skip the rest?"

I built for power users. They wanted simplicity.

**What I'm changing:**
→ Removing the complex dashboard entirely
→ Building a dead-simple single-screen view
→ Show 3 metrics that matter, hide everything else
→ Add "advanced view" as an option, not default

This completely changes my positioning from "powerful analytics" to "analytics you'll actually use."

Would this change make it better or worse for you?

(Big thanks to the 50 beta testers who told me the truth - this would've tanked at launch otherwise)"
