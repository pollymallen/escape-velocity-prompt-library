# Progress Update Post Template

**Use this template when:** You want to share weekly/regular updates on your building journey with wins AND challenges.

**Goal:** Keep your audience engaged with authentic progress updates that show both successes and struggles.

## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Progress Update" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**Product Name:**
[Your product name]

**Current Day/Week:**
[e.g., "Day 23", "Week 4", "Day 15 of the 90-day challenge"]

**This Week's Win:**
[What went well? e.g., "Finished the authentication system", "Got first 10 email signups", "Shipped the dashboard UI"]

**This Week's Challenge/Setback:**
[What's not working or causing problems? e.g., "Stripe integration keeps breaking", "Realized my database schema needs a complete rewrite", "User testing revealed people don't understand the main feature"]

**Visual/Screenshot (If Available):**
[Describe what you can show - e.g., "Screenshot of the new dashboard", "Graph showing signup growth", "Code snippet of the problem"]

**Specific Question/Help Needed:**
[What do you need help with? e.g., "How did you handle Stripe webhooks?", "Best way to refactor without breaking everything?"]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "Day [X] of building [product name]: Here's what's working (and what's breaking)..."

**Body:**
- Share one clear win from the week
- Share one challenge or setback (be specific!)
- Include a visual element if possible (screenshot, mockup, diagram)
- Balance celebration with authenticity
- Show you're making progress despite obstacles

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Anyone else dealt with [specific challenge]? How'd you solve it?"
- "What should I focus on next: [A] or [B]?"
- "Drop a comment if you want to see more of [specific feature]"

---

## Best Practices

- **Balance:** Don't make it all wins or all complaints
- **Specifics matter:** "Stripe integration failing" > "Had technical issues"
- **Visuals boost engagement:** Screenshots, even rough mockups, perform better
- **Ask specific questions:** "How do you handle webhooks?" > "Any advice?"
- **Consistency:** Pick a format and stick with it (e.g., every Monday)
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Thread format works well for detailed updates
  - LinkedIn: More professional tone, focus on learnings
  - Instagram: Visual-first, use carousel for before/after

## Example Output

"Day 23 of building [Product Name]: Here's what's working (and what's breaking)...

✅ WIN: Shipped the dashboard UI this week. Users can now see all their data in one place. Feels SO good to see it come together.

[Screenshot of dashboard]

❌ CHALLENGE: The Stripe webhook integration keeps failing in production (but works perfectly locally). I've spent 8 hours debugging and I'm losing my mind.

Anyone else dealt with Stripe webhooks timing out? How'd you solve it?

Also - should I launch with just Stripe or add PayPal before MVP? Can't decide."
