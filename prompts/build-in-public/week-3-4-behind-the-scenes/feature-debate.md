## Prompt for AI

Help me craft a "Feature Debate" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**The Common Feature You're NOT Including:**
[e.g., "Dark mode", "Social login", "Unlimited plans", "Mobile app", "Export to CSV"]

**Why You're Not Including It:**
[Your reasoning - e.g., "Adds months to development", "Creates support overhead", "Doesn't solve the core problem", "Can add later based on actual demand"]

**Your Alternative Approach:**
[What you're doing instead - e.g., "Focusing on 3 core features that solve the main pain point", "Building for desktop power users first", "Starting with email/password only"]

**What You're Prioritizing Instead:**
[What matters more to you right now - e.g., "Speed to market", "Core functionality", "User onboarding experience"]

**Your Product Context:**
[Brief context about your product to help people understand the decision]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "Hot take: [feature] is overrated. Here's what I'm building instead..."

**Body:**
- Explain a common feature you're NOT including and why
- Share your alternative approach
- Show your reasoning (not just contrarian for clicks)
- Make it about trade-offs, not absolutes
- Keep tone friendly and open to debate

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Am I making a huge mistake? Change my mind."
- "Would you skip [product] because it doesn't have [feature]?"
- "What's ONE feature you absolutely need vs. nice-to-have?"

---

## Best Practices

- **Own your reasoning:** Show thoughtful trade-offs, not laziness
- **Stay humble:** You might be wrong, show you're open to feedback
- **Context matters:** Explain your specific use case
- **Don't attack others:** "For us" not "everyone who builds [feature] is dumb"
- **Engage with disagreement:** Especially valuable insights
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Contrarian takes perform well, expect debate
  - LinkedIn: Frame as "lessons learned" more than hot take
  - Instagram: Less ideal for debate, better for Stories polls

## Example Output

"Hot take: Dark mode is overrated. I'm NOT building it for MVP. Here's why...

I could spend 2-3 weeks adding dark mode, OR I could use that time to:
→ Nail the onboarding flow (where 60% of users drop off)
→ Build the export feature users actually asked for
→ Fix the 10 bugs in my backlog

Dark mode would be cool, but it doesn't solve the core problem my product addresses. And honestly? I can add it later if people actually want it.

For MVP, I'm shipping with light mode only and using those 2-3 weeks on features that drive retention.

Am I making a huge mistake? Change my mind.

(Also: would you NOT sign up for a product just because it lacks dark mode?)"
