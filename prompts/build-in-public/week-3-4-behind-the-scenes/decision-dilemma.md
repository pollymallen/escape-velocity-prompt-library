Help me craft a "Decision Dilemma" social media post for building in public. Here's the information:

**The Decision I'm Facing:**

**Option A:**

- Pros: [List 2-3 key advantages]
- Cons: [List 2-3 key drawbacks]

**Option B:**
- Name: [e.g., "Vue"]
- Pros: [List 2-3 key advantages]
- Cons: [List 2-3 key drawbacks]

**Why This Decision Matters:**
[Context - e.g., "This affects development speed", "This impacts our ability to scale", "This determines our early user experience"]

**Your Current Leaning (Optional):**
[If you have a preference, share it and why - makes the conversation more honest]

## Post Structure

The AI should create a post following this structure:

**Hook:** "I'm at a crossroads and I need your input..."

**Body:**
- Present the real decision you're facing
- Option A vs Option B with brief pros/cons
- Keep it scannable (bullet points or short paragraphs)
- Show why you're genuinely torn
- Optional: Share which way you're leaning and why

**Engagement Ask:**
- "Which would YOU choose and why?"
- "Have you faced this decision? What did you learn?"
- "Am I missing something obvious here?"

---

## Best Practices

- **Real dilemma:** Don't ask if you've already decided
- **Balance:** Present both options fairly, not one obviously better
- **Expertise welcome:** Tag relevant experts or communities
- **Follow-up:** Share which option you chose and why
- **Platform considerations:**
  - Twitter/X: Perfect for polls + thread for context
  - LinkedIn: Longer explanation works, professional angle
  - Instagram: Use Stories quiz/poll feature

## Example Output

"I'm at a crossroads and I need your input...

Building the MVP for [product name] and stuck on tech stack:

**Option A: React**
✅ Huge ecosystem, tons of libraries
✅ My team knows it well
❌ Heavier bundle size
❌ More boilerplate code

**Option B: Vue**
✅ Faster development, simpler syntax
✅ Smaller, more performant
❌ Smaller community/ecosystem
❌ Team needs to learn it

This decision affects how fast we can ship AND how maintainable the code is long-term.

I'm leaning towards Vue for speed, but worried about the learning curve...

Which would YOU choose and why?

(Devs: am I overthinking this?)"
