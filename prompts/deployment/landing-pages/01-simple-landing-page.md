# Simple Landing Page Creator

## The Prompt

```
Create a landing page for [PRODUCT DESCRIPTION].

Keep the landing page simple with only 4 components:
1. Headline with core value proposition messaging
2. Pricing tiers
3. Core feature list in each tier
4. CTA button of "Join waitlist"

Make it clean, conversion-focused, and mobile-responsive.
```

## Example Usage

```
<!-- Example 1: AI CRM -->
Create a landing page for an AI CRM that helps business professionals nurture
important relationships by leveraging AI to take the work out of maintaining
your network manually and help identify the top potential relationships.

<!-- Example 2: Project Management Tool -->
Create a landing page for a lightweight project management tool that helps
solo founders track their work without the complexity of enterprise tools
like Jira or Asana.

<!-- Example 3: Content Calendar App -->
Create a landing page for a content calendar app that helps content creators
plan, schedule, and track their posts across multiple platforms from one
simple dashboard.
```

## What You'll Get

A minimal, conversion-focused landing page with:
- **Clear value proposition** - What problem do you solve and for whom?
- **Pricing transparency** - Build trust by showing pricing upfront
- **Feature differentiation** - What's included in each tier?
- **Low-friction CTA** - Waitlist signup (no payment required)

## Why This Structure Works

**Headline First:** Visitors decide in 3 seconds if this is for them. Lead with the outcome, not the features.

**Pricing Visible:** Hiding pricing creates friction. Show it early to qualify leads.

**Feature Tiers:** Helps visitors self-select into the right tier and shows product depth.

**Waitlist CTA:** Lower barrier than "Buy Now" for MVP validation. Measures real interest.

## Tips for Better Results

**Value Proposition Formula:**
- ❌ "AI-powered CRM platform"
- ✅ "Never lose touch with important relationships again"

**Pricing Guidance:**
- Start with 2-3 tiers maximum (Free/Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
- Clearly mark which tier is "Most Popular"
- Include annual pricing for higher perceived value

**CTA Best Practices:**
- Use action-oriented language: "Join Waitlist" not "Submit"
- Add urgency if authentic: "Join 500+ on the waitlist"
- Make button color contrast with background

## Follow-Up Prompts

Review this landing page and:
1. Suggest 3 alternative headlines focused on different pain points

3. Recommend which features to emphasize for [TARGET CUSTOMER]
