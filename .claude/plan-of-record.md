# Escape Velocity Prompt Library - Plan of Record

## Project Overview
Curated collection of AI prompts and resources for Escape Velocity students building AI products. Supports the 90-day journey from idea to revenue with prompts, platform guides, and build-in-public templates.

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-10-20)

### Completed This Session
1. ✅ Added Replit authentication integration guide (`prompts/development/authentication/replit.md`)
2. ✅ Added beginner-friendly GitHub getting started guide (`prompts/prototyping/github/getting-started-resources.md`)
3. ✅ Synced documentation with actual repository state
   - Rebranded to Escape Velocity Prompt Library
   - Added Build-in-Public category to README
   - Updated repository structure diagram
   - Enhanced CONTRIBUTING.md with resource guide standards

### Repository Content Inventory

**Well-Developed Categories:**
- ✅ **Build-in-Public** (24 files) - Complete 12-week journey with templates for each phase
- ✅ **Prototyping** (4 guides) - GitHub, Loveable.dev, Replit getting started resources
- ✅ **Development/Authentication** (1 guide) - Replit Auth integration

**Minimal Content:**
- ⚠️ **Idea Generation** (1 prompt)
- ⚠️ **User Research & Validation** (empty)
- ⚠️ **Product Brief Generation** (empty)
- ⚠️ **Workflow Brainstorming** (empty)
- ⚠️ **Deployment** (empty)
- ⚠️ **Operations** (empty)

## Strategic Priorities

### High Priority (Next Sessions)
1. **User Research & Validation** - Critical gap for Escape Velocity students validating ideas
   - User interview question templates
   - Survey design prompts
   - Persona development guides
   - Assumption testing frameworks

2. **Development Guides** - Expand beyond authentication
   - Database setup guides (Supabase, Replit DB, etc.)
   - API integration prompts
   - Deployment workflows

3. **Product Brief Generation** - Help students document their ideas
   - PRD templates
   - Feature specification prompts
   - Technical requirements generators

### Medium Priority
4. **Workflow Brainstorming** - User journey mapping prompts
5. **Deployment** - Launch checklists and go-to-market prompts
6. **Operations** - Post-launch monitoring and iteration guides

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
7. Additional prototyping platforms (Cursor, Bolt.new, etc.)
8. More idea generation prompts
9. Community contribution templates

## Delegation Opportunities

**Should Be Delegated:**
- Writing individual prompt templates → Content Writer
  *"Create 5 user research prompts following the format in build-in-public templates"*
- Testing prompts with AI tools → QA/Community Testers
  *"Test these prompts with Claude/ChatGPT and report effectiveness"*
- Curating resource lists → Research Assistant
  *"Find 10 beginner-friendly resources for [topic], test all links"*

**Keep as CEO-Level Work:**
- Strategic content roadmap decisions
- Quality standards and curation
- Community engagement strategy

## Next Session Focus

**Recommended:** Populate User Research & Validation category
- Why: Most valuable for students validating ideas early
- Scope: 5-7 prompts covering interviews, surveys, personas
- Format: Follow build-in-public template structure
- Delegation: Create first prompt as template, delegate rest to content writer

**Alternative:** Expand Development guides
- Add database setup guides for common platforms
- API integration prompt templates
- Error handling and debugging prompts

## Notes & Decisions

**Session Date: 2025-10-20**
- Decision: Focus on Escape Velocity branding throughout
- Standard: Resource guides limited to 12 links maximum (from CLAUDE.md)
- Format: Getting started guides work well for beginner students
- Note: .DS_Store files not tracked (consider adding to .gitignore)

## Repository Health
- ✅ Documentation synced with reality
- ✅ Clear directory structure
- ✅ Contributing guidelines updated
- ⚠️ Most PM lifecycle categories need content
- ⚠️ .DS_Store files should be gitignored
